0.14 Mar 20, 2007

	  O'Reilly needs for book production with help from Lakshmi
	  Sadasiv at O'Reilly.

0.13 Aug 03, 2006
	- Resolve failing tests, check for encoded entities with
	  pattern match instead of exact text match.

0.12 Jul 17, 2005
	- Now install ppod2html, ppod2txt, and ppodchecker during the
	  make or build process.
	- Applied patch from chromatic and Timothy Appnel to
	  HTML formatter to automatically escape certain characters in
	  verbatim sections.
	- Added support for listing blocks at the request of a user.

0.11 Jun 26, 2004
	- Applied patch from Boris Zentner to make example scripts 
	  use File::Basename.

	  formatter, and display a "no errors" message from the checker
	  when the file parses without errors.
	- Updated main Pod::PseudoPod module to take advantage of
	  Pod::Simple 3.02 (pieces of Pod::PseudoPod were integrated
	  into Pod::Simple).

0.10 Apr 26, 2004
	- Added the tutorial to the manifest, ooops.

0.09 Apr 24, 2004
	- Added a PseudoPod tutorial, based on O'Reilly's docs.
	- Added rudimentary text index generation.
	- Now supports 'Build' or 'make'.
	- Makefile.PL explicitly generates list of tests (change
	  suggested by Jeff Zucker because Win98 couldn't read the

	- Preserve entities in HTML formatter.
