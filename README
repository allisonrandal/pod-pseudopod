DESCRIPTION
    PseudoPOD is O'Reilly's extended set of POD tags for book manuscripts.
    Standard POD doesn't have all the markup options you might want for
    marking up files for publishing production. PseudoPOD adds a few extra
    tags for footnotes and tables, and has extended uses of "=begin" 
    elements.

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
