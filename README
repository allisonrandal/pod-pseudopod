DESCRIPTION
    PseudoPOD is O'Reilly's extended set of POD tags for book manuscripts.
    Standard POD doesn't have all the markup options you might want for
    marking up files for publishing production. PseudoPOD adds a few extra
    tags for footnotes and tables, and has extended uses of "=begin" 
    elements. See Pod::PseudoPod::Tutorial.

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

    # or

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install
   

EXTRAS
    The "examples/" directory includes a pod2html converter and a
    podchecker script that aren't in the standard installation.

      ./pod2html filename.pod

    If you also copy the sample style.css into the same directory as
    the html files you generate, the output is a tolerable simulation
    of O'Reilly's animal book format.
