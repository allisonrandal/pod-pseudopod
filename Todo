TODO list for Perl module Pod::PseudoPod

- Override _ponder_paragraph_buffer() in Pod::Simple::BlackBox to
  correctly handle PseudoPod's "=begin" entities (e.g. "=begin sidebar
  Sidebar Title"), and the POD table tags ("=headrow", "=bodyrow",
  "=row", "=cell").

- Handle N<> tags so they output document-end footnotes instead of
  inline text.

- Handle numbered E<> tags (e.g. "E<#xF6>"). (Actually, I think this
  should probably stay as is, unless O'Reilly wants the special
  characters back in this format.)

- Handle X<> tags for html output. They should create an html anchor
  (randomly generated number?), and an index list at the end of the
  document.

- Create Pod::PseudoPod::Checker, to validate pod without creating
  a full, formatted document.

- Handle code tags within Verbatim text (but still don't wrap).

- Handle code tags within =begin entities. Currently this kills the
  begin_for event, so there's no way to output content to mark that
  the =begin has started.

- Modify E<> entity handling so E<lt> and E<gt> are properly encoded
  as html entities, not as literal "<" and ">".

- Add a utility to generate an index from a list of files (module and
  script, probably).
