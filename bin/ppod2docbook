# A PseudoPod to DocBook converter script that uses
# Pod::PseudoPod::DocBook.
#
# usage:
#
# $ ppod2html [-i bookid] [-n include.xml] filename1.pod filename2.pod
#
# It produces a single XML file 'book.xml' that contains all chapters
# passed to it. 
#
# If the -i option is passed in, with a one-word identifier for the
# book, the formatter uses that identifier as part of all autogenerated
# ID tags in the book (on chapters, sections, tables, figures,
# footnotes, and index items).
#
# If the -n option is passed in, with the full path to a partial XML
# file, the contents of that file are included raw in the generated XML
# file (at the beginning of the file where the book <title> and
# <bookinfo> tags usually appear).
